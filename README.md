## Color Swap
Color swap is a casual game as a simple clone of Candy Crush. It contains no levels, but instead it goes on forever, and there is just a score. This game aims to be as least stressful as possible, without being too boring.

### How to Play
The game is simple to play. Just swipe to slide a color circle with another color circle to match up 3, 4, or 5 color circles. Getting 3 matched deletes them from the board. Getting 4 in a row creates a bomb blast. Click it or swipe it to make it explode. Match 5, and you get a rainbow. When swapped with a color circle, it deletes all of that color on the board.
